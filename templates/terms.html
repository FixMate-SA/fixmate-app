            <p>Welcome to FixMate-SA! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the FixMate-SA platform, including our WhatsApp bot service and any associated websites or dashboards ("Platform"), operated by <strong>Donald Shai Technologies (Pty) Ltd</strong> ("we," "us," or "our").</p>
            <p>By accessing or using our Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

            <h3>1. The FixMate-SA Service</h3>
            <p>FixMate-SA is a technology platform that connects individuals seeking to obtain services ("Clients") with independent, third-party service providers ("Fixers").</p>
            <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You acknowledge that FixMate-SA provides a platform to facilitate this connection. We are not an employer of Fixers. Fixers are independent contractors, and we are not responsible or liable for the actions, negligence, or work quality of any Fixer. Your contract for the service itself is between you (the Client) and the Fixer.</p>

            <h3>2. User Accounts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clients:</strong> A client account is automatically created when you interact with our WhatsApp service for the first time. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your phone number.</li>
                <li><strong>Fixers:</strong> Fixers must be onboarded and are subject to a vetting process as outlined on the Platform.</li>
                <li><strong>Administrators:</strong> An administrator ("Admin") is a user who has been granted special privileges by us to manage the platform.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. The Job Process</h3>
            <p>The job process includes a request, a quote for a call-out fee, payment for that fee, dispatch of a Fixer, acceptance by the Fixer, job completion, and a rating/feedback loop. The cost of the actual work performed beyond the call-out is negotiated directly between the Client and the Fixer.</p>

            <h3>4. Payments, Fees, and Refunds</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Client Call-Out Fee:</strong> All call-out fees are payable in advance through the Platform and are generally non-refundable once a Fixer has been dispatched.</li>
                <li><strong>Fixer Service Fee:</strong> Fixers agree to pay a service fee to FixMate-SA for each completed job, as outlined in their Fixer Agreement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Donald Shai Technologies (Pty) Ltd shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from your use of the Platform or the conduct or work of any Fixer or Client.</p>

            <h3>6. Governing Law</h3>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

            <h3>7. Contact Us</h3>
            <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at: <strong>legal@fixmatesa.co.za</strong> (or your chosen contact email).</p>
